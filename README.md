Bike Rental Count 
The dataset at hand encapsulates the hourly and daily counts of rental bikes spanning the years 2011 to 2012 within the Capital bikeshare system, accompanied by pertinent weather and seasonal information. Representing a paradigm shift from traditional bike rentals, these bike-sharing systems automate the entire processâ€”from membership to rental and return. With over 500 bike-sharing programs globally, boasting a collective fleet of more than 500,000 bicycles, these systems play a pivotal role in addressing traffic congestion, environmental concerns, and public health. Beyond their practical applications, the data generated by these systems offers a unique research opportunity. In contrast to other transportation modes like buses or subways, bike sharing records explicit details such as travel duration, departure, and arrival positions. This distinctive feature transforms bike sharing systems into virtual sensor networks, capable of capturing and monitoring city mobility. As a result, the dataset holds immense potential for detecting and understanding significant events within the urban landscape, thereby contributing to research at the intersection of transportation, environmental science, and public health.
